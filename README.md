- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rodrigops123, I'm currently a Physics undergrad in University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantum information and quantum computation, and I've been studying ML, data science, and perfecting my coding skills for quite some time now. Hopefully in the future I'll be able to unite ML and quantum information... let's see!
- ðŸ“« People can always reach me on my personal email: rodrigopesilva@outlook.com. My institutional emails (@usp.br / @if.usp.br) are public as well, but since I'm almost graduating I'm afraid these will no longer be avaible.
