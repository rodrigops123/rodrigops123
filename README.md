- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rodrigops123, I'm currently a Physics undergrad in University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantum information and quantum computation, and recently I started studying ML, data science, and perfecting my coding skills. Hopefully in the future I'll be able to unite ML and quantum information... let's see!
- ðŸ“« People can always reach me on my personal email: rodrigopesilva@outlook.com. My institutional emails (@usp.br / @if.usp.br) is public as well, but since I'm almost graduating, I'm afraid these will no longer be avaible.
- My (pretty crappy, I'll admit, have to improve this asap) CV is available here as well!
